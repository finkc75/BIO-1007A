Question 1

```{r}
x <- 1.1
a <- 2.2
b <- 3.3

z <- x^{a^{b}}
print(z)

z <- ((x^{a})^{b})
print(z)

z <- (3*x^{3})+(2*x^{2}+1)
print(z)
```

Question 2
```{r}
z <- c(seq(from =1, to = 8),seq(from =7, to =1))
print(z)

z <- c(rep(1,1), rep(2,2), rep(3,3), rep(4,4), rep(5,5))
print(z)

z <- c(rep(5,1), rep(4,2), rep(3,3), rep(2,4), rep(1,5))
print(z)
```

Question 3
```{r}
queue <- c("sheep", "fox", "owl", "ant")

queue <- c(queue[1:4],"serpent")
print(queue)

queue <- c(queue[2:5])
print(queue)

queue <- c("donkey", queue[1:4])
print(queue)

queue <- c(queue[1:4])
print(queue)

queue <- append(x = queue, "aphid", after = 3)
print(queue)

print(which(queue == "aphid"))

```
