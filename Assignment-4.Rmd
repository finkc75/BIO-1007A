Question 1  

```{r}
n_dims <- floor(runif(1, min=3, max=10))
print(n_dims)

vecn_dims <- c(1:n_dims^2)


sample(vecn_dims)

m <- matrix(vecn_dims, n_dims, n_dims)
print(m)

t(m)
print(t(m))
## This function had managed to rotate the matrix so that the numbers go horizontally.

## Sum and Mean of first row. 
sum(m[1, ])

mean(m[1,])


## Sum and Mean of the last row
sum(m[n_dims,])

mean(m[n_dims,])

```
