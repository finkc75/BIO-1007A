Question 1  

```{r}
n_dims <- floor(runif(1, min=3, max=10))
print(n_dims)

vecn_dims <- c(1:n_dims^2)


sample(vecn_dims)

m <- matrix(vecn_dims, n_dims, n_dims)
print(m)

t(m)
print(t(m))
## This function had managed to rotate the matrix so that the numbers go horizontally.

## Sum and Mean of first row. 
sum(m[1, ])

mean(m[1,])


## Sum and Mean of the last row
sum(m[n_dims,])

mean(m[n_dims,])

```

Question 2
```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(runif(16), nrow=4)
my_matrix

my_num <- c(runif(100))
my_logical <- c(my_num > 0.5)

my_letters <- sample(letters)
```

Question 3
```{r}

```
