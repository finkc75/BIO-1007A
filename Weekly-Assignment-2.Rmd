```{r}
## Quesstion 1
my_unif <- rep(NA, 26)
my_letters <- rep(NA, 26)
dFrame <- data.frame(my_unif, my_letters, stringAsFactors=F)
dFrame

myFunc <- function(mean1=10, mean2=45){
  Dframe <- data.frame(Type = rep(NA, 50), Value = rep(NA, 50))
  Dframe[1:25, 1] <- "Control"
  Dframe[26:50, 1] <- "Treatment"
  Dframe[1:25, 2] <- rnorm(n=25, mean = mean1, sd = 1.5)
  Dframe[26:50, 2] <- rnorm(n = 25, mean =mean2, sd = 2)
  return(Dframe)
}

## Question 2
Df <- myFunc()
head(Df)

## Question 3
analysis <- aov(Value ~ Type, data = Df)
summary(analysis)

## Question 4
pVal <- function(Dframe = NULL){
  anova <- aov(as.formula(paste(names(Dframe)[2], "~", names(Dframe)[1])), data = Dframe)
  return(summary(anova)[[1]][[1, "Pr(>F)"]])
}

pVal(myFunc(mean1 = 14, mean2 = 73))

## Upon changing the mean1 and mean2 values down in the evaluation of ...
## pVal() on myFunc(), it is seen that the function ...
## is viable and works as intended.  


## I also noticed for question 4 that the posted answers ...
## Had completed this step in a much more efficient way. 
## From what we were able to look up online, 
## we created a line of code that is lengthy and unnecessary.
