## About This Page  

I am Chris FInk and I would like to welcome you to my github page for the BIO 1007A Reproducible Biology in R class. I am a junior at Middlebury College pursuing a degree in Molcular Biology and Biochemistry. It is my hope that the webpage can accurately show my progression in learning this subject.
